# consolidation-unit-2020

For the consolidation unit, I would like to revisit the Visual Collage project. I would like to make a type of series out of this, by creating a brand new project that relates to my previous collage. 

For my previous collage, I created an image using Gimp that advocated for Asian American and Pacific Islander issues; the theme surrounding that was breaking the model minority -- to encourage people to stop using stereotypes to judge others. 
This next project, I was thinking of doing something regarding the current situation of COVID19 and the racially-motivated, violent, hate attacks that many Asian Americans have encountered. Once again, the project aims to clear up misperceiptions of Asians, especially in America where they have faced an increased surge of attacks towards them.

Task list:
Find an image to use
Edit image using Gimp/cartoonify
Add text
